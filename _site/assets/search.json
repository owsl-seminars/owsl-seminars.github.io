    "content": "The effects of CoViD-19 pervades through research communities across the globe,\ncausing cancelled conferences, post-poned research visits, and suspended\nprojects. Like many others, we have sought \nother opportunities for collaboration in spite of the current state of\naffairs and have therefore organized this online seminar \nseries in statistical learning.\n\nFormat\n\nWe use zoom. Each seminar is 1 hour\nlong, with roughly 50 minutes allocated to the presentation(s) and 10 minutes to\ndiscussions. You will be placed in a waiting room when entering the zoom seminar. Please\nwait for the host to let you in to the meeting.\n\nThe seminar is held on a monthly basis every second thursday of the month \nand starts at 16:30 CEST.\n\nZoom Link\n\nhttps://lu-se.zoom.us/j/65067339175\n\nCalendar Event\n\nLink to calendar event\n\nUpcoming talks\n\nThe seminar will resume in November.\n\nRecordings\n\nRecordings of previous talks are hosted at\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfRCi0V-3mvax-nWSadgMBQ.\n",
