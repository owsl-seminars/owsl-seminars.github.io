    "content": "The effects of CoViD-19 pervades through research communities across the globe,\ncausing cancelled conferences, post-poned research visits, and suspended\nprojects. Like many others, we have sought \nother opportunities for collaboration in spite of the current state of\naffairs and have therefore organized this online seminar \nseries in statistical learning.\n\nFormat\n\nWe use zoom. Each seminar is 1 hour\nlong, with roughly 50 minutes allocated to the presentation(s) and 10 minutes to\ndiscussions. You will be placed in a waiting room when entering the zoom seminar. Please\nwait for the host to let you in to the meeting.\n\nThe seminar is held on a monthly basis every second thursday of the month \nand starts at 16:30 CEST.\n\nSee Previous Talks for a list of previous talks.\n\nZoom Link\n\nhttps://lu-se.zoom.us/j/65067339175\n\nCalendar Event\n\nLink to calendar event\n\nUpcoming Talk\n\nOctober 15, 16.30 CEST\n\nJakub Gismatullin\n\n\n  Title\n  On Stirling numbers of the second type and applications\n  Abstract\n  TBA\n\n\nSubmit questions for Jakub’s talk using the form below.\n\n\n  \n    Contact\n    Name: *\n    \n\n    Email Address: *\n    \n\n    Message: *\n    \n\n    \n    \n    * indicates a required field\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to use the form.\n\nTomasz Skalski\n\n\n  Title\n  Maximum likelihood estimation for discrete \nexponential families and random graphs (tentative)\n  Abstract\n  TBA\n\n\nOrganization\n\nThis seminar series is a joint effort organized by\nThe Department of Mathematics, Wrocław University,\nThe Department of Mathematics, University of Burgundy, and\nThe Department of Statistics, Lund University.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n",
