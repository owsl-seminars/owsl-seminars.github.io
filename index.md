The effects of CoViD-19 pervade through research communities across the
globe, causing canceled conferences, postponed research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](/links), we have sought other opportunities for
collaboration in spite of the current state of affairs and have therefore
organized this online seminar series in statistical learning.

## Format

We use [zoom](https://zoom.us/) for all the sessions. Upon joining the seminar,
you will be placed in a waiting room; please wait for the host to let you in to
the meeting.

The seminars are approximately an hour long with anywhere between 20 and 40
minutes allocated to the presentation and the rest for discussion. Sessions
are held on a regular basis on Fridays at [15:30
CET](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=15%3A30%20pm&tz=Stockholm&). See
[Previous Talks](/previous-talks) for recordings, slides, and resources from
previous seminars.

Title
: Geometry of Model Pattern Recovery by Penalized and Thresholded Estimators

Abstract
: LASSO, SLOPE, OSCAR, Fused LASSO, Clustered LASSO, generalized
  LASSO... are popular penalized estimators for which the penalty term is a
  polyhedral gauge. This presentation focuses on the model pattern recovery of
  $\beta$; namely recovering the subdifferential of a polyhedral gauge at
  $\beta$, where $\beta$ is an unknown parameter of regression coefficients. For
  LASSO, when the penalty term is the $\ell_1$ norm, the model pattern of $\beta$
  only depends on the sign of $\beta$ and sign recovery via LASSO estimator is
  actually a well known topic in the literature. Furthermore, this presentation
  shows that the notion of model pattern recovery is relevant for many examples
  of polyhedral gauge penalty. Specifically, we introduce the "path condition":
  a necessary condition for model pattern recovery, via a penalized least
  squares estimator, with a probability larger than $1/2$. One may relax this
  later condition using "thresholded" penalized least squares estimators; a
  new class of estimators generalizing thresholded LASSO. Indeed, we show that
  the "accessibility condition", a condition weaker than the "path
  condition", is asymptotically sufficient for model pattern recovery. It is
  well known that penalized estimators can be not uniquely defined and, actually,
  the theory of model pattern recovery is closely related to the important issue
  of uniqueness. In this presentation we also introduce a necessary and
  sufficient condition for the uniform uniqueness of penalized least squares
  estimators.
