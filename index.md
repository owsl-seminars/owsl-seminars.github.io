# One World

The effects of CoViD-19 pervades through research communities across the globe,
causing cancelled conferences, post-poned research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](#other-one-world-seminars), we have sought 
other opportunities for collaboration in spite of the current state of
affairs and have therefore organized this online seminar 
series in statistical learning.

# Format

We are going to use [zoom](https://zoom.us/). The seminar will be 1 hour
long, with 45 minutes allocated to the presentation itself and 15 minutes to
discussions afterwards. 

Here are some ground rules for these seminars:

- Please use your real name as a handle.
- Please mute your microphone whenever you are not speaking.
- If you wish to ask a question, use the **raise hand** button in the
  **participants** window.

# Zoom link

<https://lu-se.zoom.us/j/65067339175>

# Program

The seminar is held on a weekly basis on **fridays** and will run
at least until June 12. Each seminar starts at
[16:30 CEST](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=16%3A30%20pm&tz=Warsaw&).

## Upcoming talks

### Friday, June 26, 16:30 CEST

- **Speaker**: Lukasz Smaga
- **Title**: Permutation tests for coefficients of variation in general one-way 
  ANOVA models
- **Abstract**: Coefficients of variation are unit-free measures that have many 
  applications. For example, they can be used to compare the variability of 
  different samples. To this end, we study inference methods for them as well as
  their reciprocal given by standardized means in general heterogeneous one-way
  ANOVA designs. As no specific model assumptions are made, a permutation method
  is proposed to guarantee good finite sample performance. Building on recent
  limit theorems for randomization techniques, we prove that the permutation 
  procedure is asymptotically correct in general and finitely exact when data 
  is exchangeable. These results are fostered in extensive simulation studies 
  and two illustrative data analyses.

### Friday, July 3, 16:30 CEST

- **Speaker**: Aude Sportisse
- **Title**: Robust Lasso-Zero for sparse corruption and model section with missing covariates
- **Abstract**: We propose Robust Lasso-Zero, an extension of the Lasso-Zero methodology (see Model selection with lasso-zero: adding straw to the haystack to better find needles, Descloux and Sardy, 2018), initially introduced for sparse linear models, to the sparse corruptions problem. We give theoretical guarantees on the sign recovery of the parameters for a slightly simplified version of the estimator, called Thresholded Justice Pursuit. The use of Robust Lasso-Zero is showcased for variable selection with missing values in the covariates. In addition to not requiring the specification of a model for the covariates, nor estimating their covariance matrix or the noise variance, the method has the great advantage of handling missing not-at random values without specifying a parametric model. Numerical experiments and a medical application underline the relevance of Robust Lasso-Zero in such a context with few available competitors. The method is easy to use and implemented in the R library lass0.

### Friday, July 10, 16:30 CEST

- **Speaker**: Ahmad Mousavi
- **Title**: Solution Uniqueness of Convex Piecewise Affine Functions Based Optimization with Applications to Constrained $\ell_1$ Minimization
- **Abstract**: We study the solution uniqueness of an individual feasible vector of a class of convex optimization problems involving convex piecewise affine functions and subject to general polyhedral constraints. This class of problems incorporates many important polyhedral constrained $\ell_1$ recovery problems arising from sparse optimization, such as basis pursuit, LASSO, and basis pursuit denoising.
By leveraging the max-formulation of convex piecewise affine functions and convex analysis tools, we develop dual-variables-based necessary and sufficient uniqueness conditions via simple and yet unifying approaches; these conditions are applied to $\ell_1$ minimization problems under possible polyhedral constraints. An effective linear program based scheme is proposed to verify solution uniqueness conditions. The results not only recover the known solution uniqueness conditions in the literature by removing restrictive assumptions but also yield new uniqueness conditions for much broader constrained $\ell_1$-minimization problems.
