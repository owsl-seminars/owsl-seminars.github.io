The effects of CoViD-19 pervade through research communities across the globe,
causing canceled conferences, postponed research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](/links), we have sought 
other opportunities for collaboration in spite of the current state of
affairs and have therefore organized this online seminar 
series in statistical learning.

## Format

We use [zoom](https://zoom.us/) for all the sessions. Upon joining
the seminar, you will be placed in a 
waiting room; please wait for the host to let you in to the 
meeting.

The seminars are approximately an hour long with anywhere between 20 and 40 minutes
allocated to the presentation and the rest for discussion. Sessions are held on a regular basis 
on Fridays at [15:30 CET](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=15%3A30%20pm&tz=Stockholm&).
See [Previous Talks](/previous-talks) for recordings, slides, and resources from previous
seminars.

Title
: Optimal Inference in Large-Scale Problems 

Abstract
: Bayesian modeling is ubiquitous in large-scale problems even when frequentist criteria are in mind for
  evaluating the performance of a procedure. In particular, regularized estimation methods, that may be
  derived by eliciting a prior distribution on the model parameters, have been shown especially effective
  for analyzing large data.
  
  Appealing to Robbins's compound decision theory, we introduce a theoretical framework for deriving
  optimal Bayes rules in which the prior distribution consists of permutations of the parameter vector. For
  the special case of “symmetric” statistical problems, we show that our Bayes rules also minimize the
  frequentist Risk for any fixed parameter vector configuration.
  
  Our main applicable contribution is the introduction of nonparametric deconvolution methodology, based
  on hierarchical Bayes modeling, that approximates the marginal parameter distribution. We use this
  methodology to approximate the theoretical Bayes rule. Our methodology is shown to be particularly
  effective in low-signal high-dimensional problems in which, even though it is difficult to estimate the
  components of the parameter vector, we are still able to tease out the marginal distribution of the
  parameter vector and thus, the resulting Bayes rules perform better than state of the art shrinkage
  estimators. Furthermore, as large-scale problems tend to be approximately symmetric, our Bayes rules
  provide near-optimal frequentist performance.
  
  For concreteness and clarity, I will present the theoretical framework and hierarchical Bayes modeling for
  a High-dimensional logistic regression and demonstrate its application on several simulated examples.
