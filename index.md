The effects of CoViD-19 pervade through research communities across the globe,
causing canceled conferences, postponed research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](/links), we have sought 
other opportunities for collaboration in spite of the current state of
affairs and have therefore organized this online seminar 
series in statistical learning.

## Format

We use [zoom](https://zoom.us/) for all the sessions. Upon joining
the seminar, you will be placed in a 
waiting room; please wait for the host to let you in to the 
meeting.

The seminars are approximately an hour long with anywhere between 20 and 40 minutes
allocated to the presentation and the rest for discussion. Sessions are held on a regular basis 
on Fridays at [15:30 CET](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=15%3A30%20pm&tz=Stockholm&).
See [Previous Talks](/previous-talks) for recordings, slides, and resources from previous
seminars.

Title
: Analysis of LASSO and its derivatives for variable selection under dependence among 
  covariates

Abstract
: The LASSO regression has been widely used in the high-dimensional linear regression model
  due to its capability of reducing the dimension of the problem. However, some rigid 
  assumptions on the covariates matrix and sample size, as well as the sparsity nature of the
  coefficient vector, are needed so as to guarantee the good behavior of the algorithm. Apart 
  from drawbacks related to the correct selection of covariates and bias. All these 
  characteristics have been studied assuming independence, but not under dependence structures
  among covariates. To fill this gap, examples of these drawbacks are showed by means of a 
  extensive simulation study, making use of different dependence scenarios. Besides, a broad 
  comparison with LASSO derivatives and alternatives is carried out, resulting in some 
  guidance about what procedures are the best in terms of the data nature.
