# One World

The effects of CoViD-19 pervades through research communities across the globe,
causing cancelled conferences, post-poned research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](#other-one-world-seminars), we have sought 
other opportunities for collaboration in spite of the current state of
affairs and have therefore organized this online seminar 
series in statistical learning.

# Format

We are going to use [zoom](https://zoom.us/). The seminar will be 1 hour
long, with 45 minutes allocated to the presentation itself and 15 minutes to
discussions afterwards. 

Here are some ground rules for these seminars:

- Please use your real name as a handle.
- Please mute your microphone whenever you are not speaking.
- If you wish to ask a question, use the **raise hand** button in the
  **participants** window.

# Zoom link

# Program

The seminar is held on a weekly basis on **fridays** and will run
at least until June 12. Each seminar starts at
[16:30 CEST](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=16%3A30%20pm&tz=Warsaw&).

## Upcoming talk

### Friday, May 29, 16:30 CEST

- **Speaker**: Wojciech Rejchel
- **Title**: Fast and robust procedures in high-dimensional variable selection
- **Abstract**: We investigate the variable selection problem in the single 
   index model $Y=g(\beta'X,\epsilon)$, where $g$ is unknown function. Moreover,
   we make no assumptions on the distribution of errors, existence of their
   moments etc. We propose a computationally fast variable selection procedure,
   which is based on standard Lasso with response variables replaced by their
   ranks. If response variables are binary, our approach is  even simpler: we 
   just treat their class labels as they were numbers and apply standard Lasso. 
   We present theoretical and numerical results describing variable selection 
   properties of the methods.

### Friday, June 12, 16:30 CEST

- **Speaker**: Aaron Molstad
- **Title**: Insights and algorithms for the multivariate square-root lasso
- **Abstract**: We study the multivariate square-root lasso, a method for 
  fitting the multivariate response (i.e., multi-task) linear regression 
  model with dependent errors. This estimator minimizes the nuclear norm of the 
  residual matrix plus a convex penalty. Unlike some existing methods for 
  multivariate response linear regression, which require explicit estimates of
  the error co- variance matrix or its inverse, the multivariate square-root 
  lasso criterion implicitly adapts to dependent errors and is convex. To
  justify the use of this estimator, we establish an error bound which 
  illustrates that like the univariate square-root lasso, the multivariate
  square-root lasso is pivotal with respect to the unknown error covariance
  matrix. Based on our theory, we propose a simple tuning approach which 
  requires fitting the model for only a single value of the tuning parameter,
  e.g., does not require cross-validation. We propose two algorithms to compute
  the estimator: a prox-linear alternating direction method of multipliers 
  algorithm, and an accelerated first order algorithm which can be applied in
  certain cases. In both simulation studies and a genomic data application, we 
  show that the multivariate square-root lasso can outperform more 
  computationally intensive methods which estimate both the regression 
  coefficient matrix and error precision matrix.Aaron Molstad
