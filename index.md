# One World Statistical Learning Seminars

The effects of CoViD-19 pervades through research communities across the globe,
causing cancelled conferences, post-poned research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](#other-one-world-seminars), we have sought 
other opportunities for collaboration in spite of the current state of
affairs and have therefore organized this online seminar 
series in statistical learning.

# How it works

We are going to use [zoom](). Each presentation will be at most 45 minutes
long, after which the speaker will take questions.

Here are some ground rules for these seminars:

- Please use your real name as a handle.
- Please turn off your microphone when you are not speaking.
- If you wish to ask a question, use the **raise hand** button in the
  **participants** window.
- You can chat with every participant in a private chat. A 15 minutes 
  is scheduled between the talks, for a quick hello to your colleaguesfar away.
