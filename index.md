The effects of CoViD-19 pervade through research communities across the
globe, causing canceled conferences, postponed research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](/links), we have sought other opportunities for
collaboration in spite of the current state of affairs and have therefore
organized this online seminar series in statistical learning.

## Format

We use [zoom](https://zoom.us/) for all the sessions. Upon joining the seminar,
you will be placed in a waiting room; please wait for the host to let you in to
the meeting.

The seminars are approximately an hour long with anywhere between 20 and 40
minutes allocated to the presentation and the rest for discussion. Sessions
are held on a regular basis on Fridays at [15:30
CET](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=15%3A30%20pm&tz=Stockholm&). See
[Previous Talks](/previous-talks) for recordings, slides, and resources from
previous seminars.

Title
: Nowcasting Covid-19 statistics reported with delay: a case-study of Sweden and
UK

Abstract
: Monitoring the progress of the Coronavirus is crucial for timely
implementation of intervention. The availability of unbiased timely statistics
of trends in disease events are a key to effective responses. But due to
reporting delays, the most recently reported numbers are frequently
underestimating the total number of infections, hospitalizations and deaths
creating an illusion of a downward trend. Here we describe a statistical
methodology for predicting true daily quantities and their uncertainty,
estimated using historical reporting delays. The methodology takes into account
the observed distribution pattern of the lag. It is derived from the "removal
method", a well-established estimation framework in the field of ecology. We
show how the method works for both the Swedish and the UK death count. This is
joint work with Adam Altmejd and Joacim Rocklöv.
