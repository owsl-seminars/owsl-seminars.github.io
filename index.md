The effects of CoViD-19 pervade through research communities across the globe,
causing cancelled conferences, post-poned research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](/links), we have sought 
other opportunities for collaboration in spite of the current state of
affairs and have therefore organized this online seminar 
series in statistical learning.

## Format

We use [zoom](https://zoom.us/). Each seminar is 1 hour
long, with roughly 50 minutes allocated to the presentation(s) and 10 minutes to
discussions. You will be placed in a waiting room upon entering the seminar. Please
wait for the host to let you in to the meeting.

The seminar is held on a monthly basis every second thursday of the month 
and starts at [16:30 CEST](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=16%3A30%20pm&tz=Warsaw&).
See [Previous Talks](/previous-talks) for recordings, slides, and resources from previous
seminars.

**Title**
: Maximum likelihood estimation for discrete exponential families and random graphs

**Abstract**
: We approach the problem of the existence of maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) for discrete exponential families. Using the notion of sets of uniqueness, we give new criterion for the existence of MLE. We show how this criterion can be applied in various settings, most notably of exponential models of random graphs and for linear spaces spanned by Rademacherfunctions. Additionally, we give a few remarks concerning the existence of MLE for spaces spanned by products of Rademacher functions. The research is joint work with Krzysztof Bogdan and Michał Bosy.
