The effects of CoViD-19 pervade through research communities across the
globe, causing canceled conferences, postponed research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](/links), we have sought other opportunities for
collaboration in spite of the current state of affairs and have therefore
organized this online seminar series in statistical learning.

## Format

We use [zoom](https://zoom.us/) for all the sessions. Upon joining the seminar,
you will be placed in a waiting room; please wait for the host to let you in to
the meeting.

The seminars are approximately an hour long with anywhere between 20 and 40
minutes allocated to the presentation and the rest for discussion. Sessions
are held on a regular basis on Fridays at [15:30
CET](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=15%3A30%20pm&tz=Stockholm&). See
[Previous Talks](/previous-talks) for recordings, slides, and resources from
previous seminars.

Title
: Sharp, strong, and unique minimizers for low complexity robust recovery

Abstract
: In this talk, we show the important roles of sharp minima and
strong minima for robust recovery. We also obtain several characterizations
of sharp minima for convex regularized optimization problems. Our
characterizations are quantitative and verifiable especially for the case
of decomposable norm regularized problems including sparsity,
group-sparsity, and low-rank convex problems. For group-sparsity
optimization problems, we show that a unique solution is a strong solution
and obtain quantitative characterizations for solution uniqueness.
