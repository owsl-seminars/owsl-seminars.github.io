The effects of CoViD-19 pervade through research communities across the
globe, causing canceled conferences, postponed research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](/links), we have sought other opportunities for
collaboration in spite of the current state of affairs and have therefore
organized this online seminar series in statistical learning.

## Format

We use [zoom](https://zoom.us/) for all the sessions. Upon joining the seminar,
you will be placed in a waiting room; please wait for the host to let you in to
the meeting.

The seminars are approximately an hour long with anywhere between 20 and 40
minutes allocated to the presentation and the rest for discussion. Sessions
are held on a regular basis on Fridays at [15:30
CET](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=15%3A30%20pm&tz=Stockholm&). See
[Previous Talks](/previous-talks) for recordings, slides, and resources from
previous seminars.

Title
: Sparse Graphical Modelling for Financial Applications

Abstract
: Graphical models have shown remarkable performance in uncovering the
conditional dependence structure across a set of given variables. In this paper,
we introduce two new graphical modelling approaches—called Gslope and Tslope—to
the portfolio selection literature for directly estimating the inverse of the
covariance matrix, using the so called Sorted L1-Penalized Estimator (SLOPE).
Spanning Gaussian and non- Gaussian distributed data, our new methods directly
acknowledge the empirically observed distributional characteristics of asset
returns. Extensive simulation analysis and real-world applications highlight the
superiority of our new methods, especially with regard to clustering and
stability characteristics, compared to state-of-the-art covariance matrix
estimation techniques.
