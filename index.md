## One World

The effects of CoViD-19 pervades through research communities across the globe,
causing cancelled conferences, post-poned research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](#other-one-world-seminars), we have sought 
other opportunities for collaboration in spite of the current state of
affairs and have therefore organized this online seminar 
series in statistical learning.

## Format

We use [zoom](https://zoom.us/). Each seminar is 1 hour
long, with roughly 50 minutes allocated to the presentation(s) and 10 minutes to
discussions. 

Here are some ground rules for these seminars:

- Please use your real name as a handle.
- Please mute your microphone whenever you are not speaking.
- If you wish to ask a question, use the **raise hand** button in the
  **participants** window.

You will be placed in a waiting room when entering the zoom seminar. Please
wait for the host to let you in to the meeting.
