The effects of CoViD-19 pervades through research communities across the globe,
causing cancelled conferences, post-poned research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](/links), we have sought 
other opportunities for collaboration in spite of the current state of
affairs and have therefore organized this online seminar 
series in statistical learning.

## Format

We use [zoom](https://zoom.us/). Each seminar is 1 hour
long, with roughly 50 minutes allocated to the presentation(s) and 10 minutes to
discussions. You will be placed in a waiting room when entering the zoom seminar. Please
wait for the host to let you in to the meeting.

The seminar is held on a monthly basis every second thursday of the month 
and starts at [16:30 CEST](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=16%3A30%20pm&tz=Warsaw&).
