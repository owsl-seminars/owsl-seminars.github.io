The effects of CoViD-19 pervade through research communities across the
globe, causing canceled conferences, postponed research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](/links), we have sought other opportunities for
collaboration in spite of the current state of affairs and have therefore
organized this online seminar series in statistical learning.

## Format

We use [zoom](https://zoom.us/) for all the sessions. Upon joining the seminar,
you will be placed in a waiting room; please wait for the host to let you in to
the meeting.

The seminars are approximately an hour long with anywhere between 20 and 40
minutes allocated to the presentation and the rest for discussion. Sessions
are held on a regular basis on Fridays at [15:30
CET](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=15%3A30%20pm&tz=Stockholm&). See
[Previous Talks](/previous-talks) for recordings, slides, and resources from
previous seminars.

Title
: LASSO risk and phase transition under dependence

Abstract
: For general covariance matrix, we derive the asymptotic risk of LASSO in the
limit of n and p going to infinity with fixed ratio n/p. A phase boundary is
precisely established in the phase space. Above this boundary, LASSO perfectly
recovers the signals with high probability. Below this boundary, LASSO fails to
recover the signals with high probability. While the values of the non-zero
elements of the signals do not have any effect on the phase transition curve,
our analysis shows that the curve does depend on the signed pattern of the
nonzero values of the signal for non-i.i.d. covariance matrix. Underlying our
formalism is a recently developed efficient algorithm called approximate message
passing (AMP) algorithm. We generalize the state evolution of AMP from i.i.d.
case to general case. Extensive computational experiments confirm that our
theoretical predictions are consistent with simulation results on moderate size
system.
