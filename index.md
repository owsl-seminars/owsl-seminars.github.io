# One World

The effects of CoViD-19 pervades through research communities across the globe,
causing cancelled conferences, post-poned research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](#other-one-world-seminars), we have sought 
other opportunities for collaboration in spite of the current state of
affairs and have therefore organized this online seminar 
series in statistical learning.

# Format

We are going to use [zoom](https://zoom.us/). The seminar will be 1 hour
long, with 45 minutes allocated to the presentation itself and 15 minutes to
discussions afterwards. The seminar is weekly and will run
at least until June 12.

Here are some ground rules for these seminars:

- Please use your real name as a handle.
- Please turn off your microphone when you are not speaking.
- If you wish to ask a question, use the **raise hand** button in the
  **participants** window.
