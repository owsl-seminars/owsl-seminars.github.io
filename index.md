The effects of CoViD-19 pervade through research communities across the
globe, causing canceled conferences, postponed research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](/links), we have sought other opportunities for
collaboration in spite of the current state of affairs and have therefore
organized this online seminar series in statistical learning.

## Format

We use [zoom](https://zoom.us/) for all the sessions. Upon joining the seminar,
you will be placed in a waiting room; please wait for the host to let you in to
the meeting.

The seminars are approximately an hour long with anywhere between 20 and 40
minutes allocated to the presentation and the rest for discussion. Sessions
are held on a regular basis on Fridays at [15:30
CET](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=15%3A30%20pm&tz=Stockholm&). See
[Previous Talks](/previous-talks) for recordings, slides, and resources from
previous seminars.

<!-- Title -->
<!-- : Characterizing the SLOPE Trade-off: A Variational Perspective and the  -->
<!-- Donoho--Tanner Limit -->

<!-- Abstract -->
<!-- : Sorted l1 regularization has been incorporated into many methods for solving -->
<!-- high-dimensional statistical estimation problems, including the SLOPE estimator -->
<!-- in linear regression. In this paper, we study how this relatively new -->
<!-- regularization technique improves variable selection by characterizing the -->
<!-- optimal SLOPE trade-off between the false discovery proportion (FDP) and true -->
<!-- positive proportion (TPP) or, equivalently, between measures of type I error and -->
<!-- power. Assuming a regime of linear sparsity and working under Gaussian random -->
<!-- designs, we obtain an upper bound on the optimal trade-off for SLOPE, showing -->
<!-- its capability of breaking the Donoho-Tanner power limit. To put it into -->
<!-- perspective, this limit is the highest possible power that the Lasso, which is -->
<!-- perhaps the most popular l1-based method, can achieve even with arbitrarily -->
<!-- strong effect sizes. Next, we derive a tight lower bound that delineates the -->
<!-- fundamental limit of sorted l1 regularization in optimally trading the FDP off -->
<!-- for the TPP. Finally, we show that on any problem instance, SLOPE with a certain -->
<!-- regularization sequence outperforms the Lasso, in the sense of having a -->
<!-- smaller FDP, larger TPP and smaller l2 estimation risk simultaneously. Our -->
<!-- proofs are based on a novel technique that reduces a variational calculus -->
<!-- problem to a class of infinite-dimensional convex optimization problems and a -->
<!-- very recent result from approximate message passing theory. -->
