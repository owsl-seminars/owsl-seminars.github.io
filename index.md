The effects of CoViD-19 pervade through research communities across the
globe, causing canceled conferences, postponed research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](/links), we have sought other opportunities for
collaboration in spite of the current state of affairs and have therefore
organized this online seminar series in statistical learning.

## Format

We use [zoom](https://zoom.us/) for all the sessions. Upon joining the
seminar, you will be placed in a waiting room; please wait for the host to
let you in to the meeting.

The seminars are approximately an hour long with anywhere between 20 and 40
minutes allocated to the presentation and the rest for discussion. Sessions
are held on a regular basis on Fridays at [15:30
CET](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=15%3A30%20pm&tz=Stockholm&). See
[Previous Talks](/previous-talks) for recordings, slides, and resources from
previous seminars.

Title
: On the Maximum a Posteriori partition in nonparametric Bayesian mixture models

Abstract
: In nonparametric Bayesian mixture models we assume that the data is an iid
  sample from an infinite mixture of component distributions; the mixture
  weights and the parameters of the components are random. This approach can
  be applied to cluster analysis; in this context it is convenient to think
  that we have a prior distribution on the space of all possible partitions of
  data (e.g. the Chineses Restaurant Process) and the likelihood is obtained
  by marginalising the parameter out of component distributions. This can be
  transformed into the posterior on the space of possible clusterings; as is
  rather common in the Bayesian setting, this posterior is known up to
  intractable normalising constant.  During the talk we are going to present
  some properties of the MAP partition - the one that maximises the posterior
  probability. Firstly we will describe the results of (1) that concern the
  Chinese Restaurant prior on partitions and the component distributions being
  multivariate Gaussian with unknown mean but known (and the same for all
  components) covariance. Those findings concern the geometry of the MAP
  partition (we prove that in this case the MAP clusters are linearly separated
  from each other) and its asymptotic behaviour. Then we will show
  generalisations of some of these results to general infinite mixture models,
  when the component measures and the prior on their parameters belong to
  conjugate exponential families. Finally we present a 'score function' for
  clusterings, related to our analysis. This score function can be used to
  choose among clustering propositions suggested by more computationally
  efficient algorithms, like K-means.
