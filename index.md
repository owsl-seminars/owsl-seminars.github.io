The effects of CoViD-19 pervade through research communities across the
globe, causing canceled conferences, postponed research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](/links), we have sought other opportunities for
collaboration in spite of the current state of affairs and have therefore
organized this online seminar series in statistical learning.

## Format

We use [zoom](https://zoom.us/) for all the sessions. Upon joining the seminar,
you will be placed in a waiting room; please wait for the host to let you in to
the meeting.

The seminars are approximately an hour long with anywhere between 20 and 40
minutes allocated to the presentation and the rest for discussion. Sessions
are held on a regular basis on Fridays at [15:30
CET](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=15%3A30%20pm&tz=Stockholm&). See
[Previous Talks](/previous-talks) for recordings, slides, and resources from
previous seminars.

<!-- Title -->
<!-- : Coordinate Descent for SLOPE -->
<!---->
<!-- Abstract -->
<!-- : The lasso is the most famous sparse regression and feature selection  -->
<!-- method. One reason for its popularity is the speed at which the  -->
<!-- underlying optimization problem can be solved. Sorted L-One Penalized  -->
<!-- Estimation (SLOPE) is a generalization of the lasso with appealing  -->
<!-- statistical properties. In spite of this, the method has not yet reached  -->
<!-- widespread interest. A major reason for this is that current software  -->
<!-- packages that fit SLOPE rely on algorithms that perform poorly in high  -->
<!-- dimensions. To tackle this issue, we propose a new fast algorithm to  -->
<!-- solve the SLOPE optimization problem, which combines proximal gradient  -->
<!-- descent and proximal coordinate descent steps. We provide new results on  -->
<!-- the directional derivative of the SLOPE penalty and its related SLOPE  -->
<!-- thresholding operator, as well as provide convergence guarantees for our  -->
<!-- proposed solver. In extensive benchmarks on simulated and real data, we  -->
<!-- show that our method outperforms a long list of competing algorithms. -->
