# One World Statistical Learning Seminars

Some stuff about this project.

## How it works

We are going to use [zoom](). Each presentation will be at most 45 minutes
long, after which the speaker will take questions.

Here are some ground rules for these seminars:

- Please use your real name as a handle.
- Please turn off your microphone when you are not speaking.
- If you wish to ask a question, use the **raise hand** button in the
  **participants** window.
- You can chat with every participant in a private chat. A 15 minutes 
  is scheduled between the talks, for a quick hello to your colleaguesfar away.
