The effects of CoViD-19 pervade through research communities across the globe,
causing canceled conferences, postponed research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](/links), we have sought 
other opportunities for collaboration in spite of the current state of
affairs and have therefore organized this online seminar 
series in statistical learning.

## Format

We use [zoom](https://zoom.us/) for all the sessions. Upon joining
the seminar, you will be placed in a 
waiting room; please wait for the host to let you in to the 
meeting.

The seminars are approximately an hour long with anywhere between 20 and 40 minutes
allocated to the presentation and the rest for discussion. Sessions are held on a regular basis 
on Fridays at [15:30 CEST](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=15%3A30%20pm&tz=Stockholm&).
See [Previous Talks](/previous-talks) for recordings, slides, and resources from previous
seminars.

Title
: Convex Clustering: Methods, Theory, Algorithms, and Visualizations

Abstract
: Convex clustering is a promising new approach to the classical problem
of clustering, combining strong performance in empirical studies with
rigorous theoretical foundations. The past few years have seen a surge
of interest in convex clustering and breakthroughs in associated
theory and methodology. In this talk, I will review this exciting
literature, with a particular focus on novel computational strategies
developed to construct dendrograms and interactive visualizations from
convex clustering approaches. This talk reflects joint work with
Genevera Allen, Yue Hu, George Michailidis, John Nagorski, Mitch
Rodenberry, Minjie Wang, and Tianyi Yao.
