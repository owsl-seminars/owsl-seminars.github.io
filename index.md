# One World

The effects of CoViD-19 pervades through research communities across the globe,
causing cancelled conferences, post-poned research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](#other-one-world-seminars), we have sought 
other opportunities for collaboration in spite of the current state of
affairs and have therefore organized this online seminar 
series in statistical learning.

# Format

We are going to use [zoom](https://zoom.us/). The seminar will be 1 hour
long, with 45 minutes allocated to the presentation itself and 15 minutes to
discussions afterwards. 

Here are some ground rules for these seminars:

- Please use your real name as a handle.
- Please turn off your microphone when you are not speaking.
- If you wish to ask a question, use the **raise hand** button in the
  **participants** window.

# Program

The seminar is held on a weekly basis on **fridays** and will run
at least until June 12. Each seminar starts at
[16:30 CEST](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=16%3A30%20pm&tz=Warsaw&).

## Upcoming talks

### May 22, Jaroslaw Harezlak: Brain imaging and wearable devices; statistical learning to the rescue

**ABSTRACT**: The amount of medical data collected has been growing exponentially 
over the past few decades. This growth in data acquisition has not been, 
unfortunately, paralleled by the same growth rate of statistical learning 
methods’ development. In my talk, I will give a brief overview of the analytical
methods developed by my group and their applications in the medical and public 
health areas. Specifically, (1) regularization methods applied to the structural
brain imaging data and (2) signal processing techniques utilized in extracting
physical activity information from the raw accelerometry data will be 
emphasized. 

1. A challenging problem in the brain imaging research is a principled 
   incorporation of information from different imaging modalities in 
   regression models. Frequently, data from each modality is analyzed 
   separately using, for instance, dimensionality reduction techniques, 
   which result in a loss of information. We proposed a class of novel 
   regularization method to estimate the association between the brain 
   structure features and a scalar outcome within the generalized linear 
   regression framework.
2. Quantification of physical activity in a free-living environment is 
   a challenging task. I will summarize our work utilizing data collected 
   from the tri-axial wrist-worn accelerometers quantifying sedentary, 
   upright and ambulatory behavior. A number of algorithms extracting
   features of physical activity and their association with health outcomes 
   will be presented.
 
**BIOGRAPHY**: Dr. Harezlak is a Professor and an Interim Co-chair of the 
Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the Indiana University 
School of Public Health-Bloomington, U.S.A. After graduating from Harvard 
University and 2 years of post-doctoral training at the Harvard School of 
Public Health, he joined Indiana University where he has been since. He has 
held a visiting appointment at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, U.S.A. 
and is an adjunct professor at the University of Wroclaw, Poland. His interests
span a number of medical areas including mild traumatic brain injury, 
neurodegenerative diseases and physical activity as well as statistical areas 
including semiparametric regression, functional data analysis, brain imaging 
and intensively-collected longitudinal data.
