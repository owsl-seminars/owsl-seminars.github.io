The effects of CoViD-19 pervade through research communities across the
globe, causing canceled conferences, postponed research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](/links), we have sought other opportunities for
collaboration in spite of the current state of affairs and have therefore
organized this online seminar series in statistical learning.

## Format

We use [zoom](https://zoom.us/) for all the sessions. Upon joining the
seminar, you will be placed in a waiting room; please wait for the host to
let you in to the meeting.

The seminars are approximately an hour long with anywhere between 20 and 40
minutes allocated to the presentation and the rest for discussion. Sessions
are held on a regular basis on Fridays at [15:30
CET](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=15%3A30%20pm&tz=Stockholm&). See
[Previous Talks](/previous-talks) for recordings, slides, and resources from
previous seminars.

Title
: A precise high-dimensional asymptotic theory for AdaBoost

Abstract
: This talk will introduce a precise high-dimensional asymptotic theory for
  AdaBoost on separable data, taking both statistical and computational
  perspectives. We will consider the common modern setting where the number of
  features p and the sample size n are both large and comparable, and in
  particular, look at scenarios where the data is separable in an asymptotic
  sense. Under a class of statistical models, we will provide an
  (asymptotically) exact analysis of the generalization error of AdaBoost, when
  the algorithm interpolates the training data and maximizes an empirical L1
  margin. On the computational front, we provide a sharp analysis of the
  stopping time when boosting approximately maximizes the empirical L1 margin.
  Our theory provides several insights into properties of Boosting; for
  instance, the larger the dimensionality ratio p/n, the faster the
  optimization reaches interpolation. At the heart of our theory lies an
  in-depth study of the maximum L1-margin, which can be accurately described by
  a new system of non-linear equations; we analyze this margin and the
  properties of this system, using Gaussian comparison techniques and a novel
  uniform deviation argument. Time permitting, I will present a new class of
  boosting algorithms that correspond to Lq geometry, for q>1, together with
  results on their high-dimensional generalization and optimization behavior.
  This is based on joint work with Tengyuan Liang.
