The effects of CoViD-19 pervade through research communities across the globe,
causing cancelled conferences, post-poned research visits, and suspended
projects. Like [many others](/links), we have sought 
other opportunities for collaboration in spite of the current state of
affairs and have therefore organized this online seminar 
series in statistical learning.

## Format

We use [zoom](https://zoom.us/). Each seminar is 1 hour
long, with roughly 50 minutes allocated to the presentation(s) and 10 minutes to
discussions. You will be placed in a waiting room upon entering the seminar. Please
wait for the host to let you in to the meeting.

The seminar is held on a monthly basis every second thursday of the month 
and starts at [16:30 CEST](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=16%3A30%20pm&tz=Warsaw&).
See [Previous Talks](/previous-talks) for recordings, slides, and resources from previous
seminars.

## Upcoming Talk

### December 10, [16:30 CEST](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=16%3A30%20pm&tz=Warsaw&)

#### Waheed U. Bajwa (Rutgers University)

Title
: Extended Sure Independence Screening for Big Data Analytics

Abstract
: We are living in the age of big data, in which devices ranging from smartphones and thermostats to wearable fitness trackers and intelligent personal assistants have the ability to generate millions of data points on a daily basis. Unfortunately, exploratory and predictive data analytics can be computationally prohibitive for ultrahigh-dimensional datasets. Correlation-based screening, in which one leverages marginal correlations for removal of irrelevant variables prior to data analytics, can be used to overcome this challenge. Prior works on correlation-based variable screening either impose strong statistical priors on the model or assume specific post-screening analytics techniques. In this talk, we extend the analysis of correlation-based variable screening to arbitrary linear models and post-screening inference techniques. In particular, (i) we show that a condition---termed the screening condition---is sufficient for successful correlation-based screening of linear models, and (ii) we provide insights into the dependence of marginal correlation-based screening on different problem parameters.
