On **December 13, 08:00 to 12:00 CET**, we will be running a mini-conference on
recent advances in Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation (SLOPE), featuring speakers
from across the world.

We will use [zoom](https://zoom.us/) for the conference and the link for the
conference is <https://lu-se.zoom.us/j/65067339175>. Upon joining, you will be
placed in a waiting room; please wait for the host to let you in to the meeting.

#### Title

Degrees of freedom in submodular regularization: A computational perspective
of Stein’s unbiased risk estimate

#### Abstract

Degrees of freedom (DF) is a quantity that can be interpreted as the effective
number of model parameters. DF of some popular estimators are calculated by
surprizingly simple formulae: For example, DF of Lasso is the number of non-zero
coefficients, and DF of Fused Lasso is the number of distinct values in
coefficients. In this talk, I will introduce a unified degrees-of-freedom
formula for a class of convex regularization estimators, which we call
submodular regularization. Submodular regularization can represent various
structured sparsity related to combinatorial objects (e.g., directed/undirected
graphs, hypergraphs), and contains many existing penalized estimators, such as
Lasso, Fused Lasso, nearly-isotonic regression, and SLOPE. Our DF formula is
simple and easily implemented, and the formula does not depend on the underlying
combinatorial object.

#### Title

Solving the OSCAR and SLOPE Models Using a Semismooth Newton-Based Augmented
Lagrangian Method

#### Abstract

The octagonal shrinkage and clustering algorithm for regression (OSCAR),
equipped with the l1-norm and a pair-wise l1-norm regularizer, is a useful tool
for feature selection and grouping in high-dimensional data analysis. The
computational challenge posed by OSCAR, for high dimensional and/or large sample
size data, has not yet been well resolved due to the non-smoothness and
non-separability of the regularizer involved. In this talk, we will resolve this
numerical challenge by proposing a sparse semismooth Newton based augmented
Lagrangian method to solve the more general SLOPE (the sorted L-one penalized
estimation) model. By appropriately exploiting the inherent sparse and low-rank
property of the generalized Jacobian of the semismooth Newton system in the
augmented Lagrangian subproblem, we show how the computational complexity can be
substantially reduced. Our algorithm offers a notable computational advantage in
the high-dimensional statistical regression settings. Numerical experiments are
conducted on real data sets, and the results demonstrate that our algorithm is
far superior, in both speed and robustness, to the existing state-of-the-art
algorithms based on first-order iterative schemes, including the widely used
accelerated proximal gradient (APG) method and the alternating direction method
of multipliers (ADMM).
